# Customer RFM Analysis
## Problem Statement
Understanding customer buying behavior is crucial for businesses aiming to enhance customer engagement and tailor marketing strategies effectively. RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis is a powerful tool utilized for precisely this purpose. The analysis involves evaluating three key aspects:

Recency (R): Represents the date of the customer's last purchase. It helps gauge how recently a customer has interacted with the business.

Frequency (F): Indicates how often a customer makes purchases. This metric is essential for identifying loyal and repeat customers.

Monetary Value (M): Reflects the total amount spent by a customer. It provides insights into a customer's overall value to the business.

## Project Overview
This project aims to implement RFM analysis to gain actionable insights into customer behavior. By leveraging historical purchase data, we can segment customers based on recency, frequency, and monetary value. These segments enable businesses to tailor marketing strategies, identify high-value customers, and optimize engagement.
